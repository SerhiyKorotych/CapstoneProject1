        <h2><b>Summary</b></h2>
        <p>I'm a very friendly and optimistic person, with passion for web development and technology.
            Before I started coding I worked in several different places, which helped me develop a wide range of soft-skills that helped me grow into a hard-working person. Additionally I have assisted my family business as much as possible (working as a gardener, painter, construction and other small jobs).
            I first started coding when I was studying multimedia in high school.
            As I grew up I decided to focus my professional career on coding and that's when I joined the Wild Code School.
            As a student I learned how to work with several different languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, React. Express. MySQL, Node.js) and I look forward to find a professional opportunity in this field.</p>
